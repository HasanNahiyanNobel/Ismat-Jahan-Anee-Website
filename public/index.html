I am Ismat Jahan Anee. I am a molecular biologist based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. My research interest incorporates cell biology, aging, host-pathogen interactions, infectious disease, and therapeutic drugs.<p>My master's thesis dissertation was on cellular aging. Using a single cell organism, Yeast (<span class="fst-italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>), as a model organism I endeavored to decode the role of DNA repair genes on cellular lifespan.<p>I explored the host-pathogen interactions to leverage the potential impact of probiotics on animal health while working on my review paper “The Role of Probiotics on animal health and nutrition”.<p>Currently, I am working as a research fellow at BCSIR, Bangladesh. My project objective is to isolate and classify microplastics from frequently applied fish feeds in aquaculture sector in Bangladesh.<p>My experiences fired my inspiration toward cell molecular and developmental biology, and I am determined to pursue a Ph.D. in molecular bioscience.<p>Thank you for stopping by!</div><div class="col col-12 col-lg-1"></div><div class="col col-12 col-lg-5 ps-5 pb-5 pe-5"><img src="images/cover.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded-circle" alt="Profile Photo"><div id="contact" class="mt-5 text-center"><div class="row"><div class="col col-sm-12 col-md-6"><div class="row"><div class="col col-4"><a href="mailto:ismatjahan005@gmail.com"><img class="m-2" src="images/envelope_fill.svg" width="32" height="32" alt=""></a></div><div class="col col-4"><a href="tel:+8801757730171"><img class="m-2" src="images/telephone_fill.svg" width="32" height="32" alt=""></a></div><div class="col col-4"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismat-jahan-anee/" target="_blank"><img class="m-2" src="images/linkedin.svg" width="32" height="32" alt=""></a></div></div></div><div class="col col-sm-12 col-md-6"><div class="row"><div class="col col-4"><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9gq1624AAAAJ" target="_blank"><img class="m-2" src="images/google_scholar.svg" width="32" height="32" alt=""></a></div><div class="col col-4"><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8225-5661" target="_blank"><img class="m-2" src="images/orcid.svg" width="32" height="32" alt=""></a></div><div class="col col-4"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ismat-Jahan-Anee" target="_blank"><img class="m-2" src="images/research_gate.svg" width="32" height="32" alt=""></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="research" class="mt-5"><h3 class="text-center mb-3">Research</h3><div><div class="bg-light p-3 mb-2"><p class="fw-bold mb-0">“The effect of RAD7 gene’s null mutation on single-cell aging”<p class="mb-0">2022</div><p class="mb-1">Status: Published (Microbial Bioactives)<p>Keywords: DNA Repair Gene; mitochondria; cell aging; RAD7; Saccharomyces cerevisiae<p>Every living form on earth experiences spontaneous biological modifications as it ages. As organisms age, they go through a constant deterioration in biological and cognitive capacity, decreased organismal function, diverse diseases, and eventually, senescence. The DNA repair system that protects the genome also malfunctions with time. This study aims to discover whether manipulating a DNA repair gene (RAD7, in this case) can regulate the cellular life span. The study was conducted on Yeast's (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) chronological lifespan to receive a quick and easy observation of the impacts. RAD7, a NER gene works in the NER system to correct the UV-damaged DNA. To decipher the effects of RAD7 gene deletion on single-cell aging experiments i.e. life span assay, growth proliferation status, respiratory phenotypic characterization, mitochondrial DNA abundance, and gene-gene interaction were conducted. In the chronological lifespan assay, it was found that the RAD7 gene’s null mutation (Δrad7) had a prolonged stationary phase compared to the wild-type strain. The mutant displayed respiration potency by growing well on a glycerol-based medium. Fluorescence microscopic observations disclosed that the mutants had a lower abundance of mtDNA compared to the control. Furthermore, RAD7 gene interaction analysis demonstrated how it interacts with other genes in the organism. Mutation of this repair gene affects mtDNA distribution and mtDNA abundance, yet cells could survive in the chronological phase. MtDNA depletion is a sign of altered mitochondrial morphology and function that may activate a retrograde response from mitochondria to the nucleus. Further efforts are required to draw a fine conclusion.</div><div><div class="bg-light p-3 mb-2"><p class="fw-bold mb-0">“Microplastics in Fish Feed: An Alarming Issue in Aquaculture Sector of Bangladesh.”<p class="mb-0">2022</div><p class="mb-1">Status: Ongoing<p>Keywords: Microplastics; fish feed; fish meal<p>The negative impact of plastic debris accumulation in aquatic ecosystems is a planetary boundary threat that has been widely recognized in recent decades. Microplastics are Plastic particles, smaller than 5 mm. Due to their universality and persistence in the environment, microplastics as contaminants have become an emerging global concern. Many sources can cause MP pollution in freshwater ecosystems, including weathering degradation of plastic waste, wastewater treatment plant sewage discharge, and surface runoff. Bangladesh is one of the world’s leading fish-producing countries in the world. According to the FAO report “The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2018”, Bangladesh ranked 3rd in inland open water capture production and 5th in world aquaculture production. To ensure and maintain this huge fish production, different fish feeds are used frequently in hatcheries, fish farms, ponds, etc. In this study, we aim to decipher the microplastic particles in commonly used fish feed, including fish meal from different hatcheries in Bangladesh. The work on this project is currently going on and hoping to finish by January 2023. For this study, we will buy fish feed samples from local markets in different regions of Bangladesh. Microplastics will be extracted from each sample by performing the density separation. After the final separation, the supernatant suspensions will be filtered using a membrane filter to obtain the solid particles. The solid particles then will be digested, filtered, dried, and then observed under the microscope to separate the microplastic particles. A stereo microscope will be used to count the microplastics based on their physical characteristics (i.e., particle color, size, and type). Microplastic particles will be identified and verified to detect the type of polymer using micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR). Suspected microplastics will be photographed using a high-resolution camera. Finally, the data will be analyzed statistically and the findings will be published as a journal article.</div><div><div class="bg-light p-3 mb-2"><p class="fw-bold mb-0">“The role of probiotics on animal health and probiotics”<p class="mb-0">2021</div><p class="mb-1">Status: Published (SpringerNature)<p>Keywords: Probiotics; Poultry, Ruminant, Aquaculture, Immunity, Animal health<p>The constant global demand for food requires colossal food production which is much heftier than what we are capable of growing and harvesting. Antibiotics have been used in healthy food production to promote growth and prevent diseases. Prolonged use of antibiotics leads to the development of resistant bacteria and the accumulation of antibiotic residue in livestock and fish. To avoid further causalities finding an effective alternative became a dire need. The most suitable alternative for antibiotics is probiotics. Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide health benefits when consumed or applied to the body with the optimum amount. Probiotics are mainly good bacteria and yeast which fight off pathogenic bacteria, improve the immune system, and restore the gut microbial balance. Probiotics can eliminate harmful pathogens following several molecular mechanisms and modulate the immune response of the host animal. My review article explains probiotics as a potential growth promoter in major food sectors (poultry, ruminant, and aquaculture), how probiotics can ensure food safety without detrimental effects on animals, and some points where further research is mandated. Moreover, the article accentuates how knowledge gaps can be minimized using modern molecular technologies to establish probiotic supplements as an effective alternative to antibiotics.</div><div><div class="bg-light p-3 mb-2"><p class="fw-bold mb-0">“The Role of DNA Repair Genes on Cellular Aging” (Master’s Thesis Work)<p class="mb-0">2021</div><p class="mb-1">Status: Completed<p><p>‘Why we age’ and ‘how we age’ has been a matter of debate for centuries. Over time a post-mitotic cell age with the accumulation of mutation within its genome and reach senescence which implies that the DNA repair system itself is affected by age. Using the single-cell model Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this research work aims to find out the role of DNA repair genes (MSH1, MSH3 & RAD7) in regulating the cellular life span; precisely on chronological lifespan. To characterize these mutant cells, growth-proliferation and respiration status, spontaneous mtDNA mutation rate, and mtDNA abundance were determined. Bioinformatics analysis was also conducted to find out gene-gene interaction using FunSpec and SGD Database. Results demonstrated that Δmsh1, Δmsh3, and Δrad7 had a prolonged stationary phase compared to the wild-type strain (BY4743). Fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that the mutants had a lower abundance of mtDNA compared to the control. Erythromycin resistant assay exhibited a two-to-five-fold higher spontaneous mutation rate in mutants’ mtDNA, indicating they are essential in maintaining the mitochondrial genome. Gene-gene interactions analysis demonstrated that mutants function in the pathway involved in cell cycle checkpoints which may facilitate a longer stationary phase. With this research, it was specified that these DNA repair genes influence cellular lifespan.</div><div><div class="bg-light p-3 mb-2"><p class="fw-bold mb-0">“A Report on Water Analysis and Parameters of the Sundarban Rivers” (Undergraduate Field Work)<p class="mb-0">2018</div><p class="mb-1">Status: Completed<p><p>The Sundarbans region shared by Bangladesh and India is one of the richest ecosystems in the world. It contains arguably the world's largest remaining area of mangroves and is known for its exceptional biodiversity, including numerous threatened species. Sundarbans is famous for its marine and estuarine fish resources. A large population is dependent on fishery activity and fish capturing is treated as the backbone of the Sundarbans economy (Ganesh, 2003). Water, one of the four elements of earth, is essential to support the myriad life forms harbored by Sundarbans. The diversity of fish, crustaceans, and other aquatic organisms in the aquatic system depends on a suitable environment in which they can reproduce and grow. Because these organisms live in water, the major environmental concern within the system is water quality. This study aimed to assess the condition of water in Sundarbans by testing different water quality parameters. Because when water quality is poor, it affects not only aquatic life but the surrounding ecosystem as well. We measured the pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature, and water transparency from seven different sites in Sundarbans region. We used pH meter for pH analysis, refractometer for salinity analysis, dissolved oxygen meter for dissolved oxygen and temperature analysis, and Secchi disc for water transparency analysis. The range of pH value was 7.9-8.1, Dissolved oxygen (DO) was 4.83 ppm-6.45 ppm, Salinity was 30 ppt- 25ppt, and water temperature was between 20 °C-26.9 °C which are all within the range of water quality parameters of estuarine water. In only one site, Hironpoint we get pH value of 9.1 and salinity of 2 ppt. This is because it was a navy quarter pond and bleach might be added to the reservoir and the surrounding seawater might get mixed and increase salinity.</div><div><div class="bg-light p-3 mb-2"><p class="fw-bold mb-0">“Investigation of Wild to Domestic Bird Avian Influenza Transmission: A Multiyear Monitoring and Surveillance Program, IUCN”<p class="mb-0">2017, 2018</div><p class="mb-1">Status: Completed<p><p>Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus in wild and migratory birds is a multi-spectral issue. It is important to find out the role of wild birds in the transmission of HPAI H5N1 to domestic birds. So, IUCN, Bangladesh is running a project to carry out appropriate targeted surveillance of wild and domestic bird populations, routes of migration, and species involved in transmitting the disease that will act as a baseline and will provide an early warning system on HPAI H5N1 and to improve understanding of avian influenza ecology in Bangladesh. The work has been divided into three major categories: Bird Census, Bird Ringing, and Swab-sample Collection. These tasks are usually performed separately and when results are combined can give a holistic idea of the presence of avian diseases, the risk of transmission, and severity of the threats. This Avian Influenza transmission project is a multi-year work and I joined as a volunteer team member and team member in 2017 & 2018 respectively, to get trained and work on bird ringing and swab collection in the haor area of Bangladesh. Bird ringing is the attachment of small metal or plastic tag to the leg or the wing of a wild bird to enable individual identification. Through this process of subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird information on migration, longevity, mortality, population studies, territoriality, and feeding behavior can be learned and avian influenza testing can also be performed by sample collection from wild birds.</div></div><div id="publications" class="mt-5"><h3 class="text-center mb-3">Publications</h3><div><p class="mb-1 lead">2022<p><a href="https://publishing.emanresearch.org/Journal/Abstract/microbbioacts-514307" target="_blank">“The effect of RAD7 gene’s null mutation on single-cell aging”.</a> <span class="fw-bold">Ismat Jahan Anee</span>, Reza Md Shahjahan, Rowshan Ara Begum, Mohammad Shamimul Alam, Ashfaqul Muid Khandaker.
